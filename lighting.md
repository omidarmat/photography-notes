# **Principles of light**

**1. Size of the light source:** determines what types of shadows are produced, and may affect the type of reflection.

**2. Types of reflection:** 3 types are possible from any surface. determines the look of any surface.

**3. Family of angles:** some types of reflections only occur if light strikes the surface from within a limited family of angles. After deciding what type of reflection we need, family of angles will determine where the light should or should not be.

# **How to describe light**

As photographers, we are mainly concerned with the brightness, color, and contrast of the light.

## **brightness**

This is the single most important quality of a light source. A brighter light is almost always a better light.

## **color**

Most photographs are made with white light. It is a roughly even mix of three primary colors; red, green, and blue.

The color of light is measured using a physical scale called color temperature. Photographers use 3 standard color temperatures: 5500 K (daylight), 3200 K and 3400 K (tungsten).

## **contrast**

A light source has high-contrast if its rays all strike the subject from nearly the same angle. Light rays from a low-contrast source strike the subject from many different angles.

The easiest way to recognize the contrast of a light source is to look at the appearance of the shadows.

For single light sources, the **size** of that source is the primary factor influencing its contrast, but the **distance** of the light source to the subject is also an important factor.

> _Note_ | covering a small light source with a large _translucent_ material is one way to increase its size and, therefore, to soften it.

# **How the subject affects lighting**

Different subjects change the light in different ways. The subject can do 3 things to the light that strikes it: transmit, absorp, reflect.

## **Transmission (& refraction)**

This is when light passes through the subject. clean air and clear glass are examples of such materials.

Simple transmission only occur if light strikes the subject at a perpendicular angle. At any other angle, the transmission of light has accompanying **refraction**.

If a subject fully transmits the light, it cannot be seen or photoghraphed. However, when refraction happens, the subject can be seen and photographed.

### **Direct and diffuse transmission**

Materials such as white glass and thin paper scatter the light rays in many random, unpredictable directions as they pass through. This is called diffuse transmission.

Materials causing diffuse transmission are called _translucent_ to distinguish them from _transparent_ materials.

Translucent subjects are of little importance to photographers because their translucence usually requires no special lighting consideration. They always absorp some of the light and reflect some of the light, in addition to transmitting it.

**Absorption** and **reflection** are more major influences on photographic lighting.

## **Absorption**

Absorped light is never seen again as visible light. It tunes into heat and is stored invisibly in the subject. So simple absorption cannot be seen or photographed. It can only be visble when we compare it to other light in the scene that is not absorped.

Partial absorption of light is one of the factors determining whether we see a subject as black, white, or some intermediate gray.

Any particular subject will also absorp some frequencies of light more than others. This selective absorption of certain light frequencies is one of the factors determining the color of a subject.

## **Reflection**

Reflection makes vision possible.

# **Reflection and the family of angles**

Of the three ways the subject can affect the lighting, reflection is the most visible one. Photographic lighting is primarily an exercise in reflection management.

Subjects reflect light differently.

## **Types of reflection**

Light can reflect from a subject as _diffuse reflection_, _direct reflection_, or _glare_. Most surfaces cause some of each of these three types. The proportion of each type, vary with the subject, and these proportions determine how a surface looks like.

### **Diffuse reflection**

No surface produce perfectly diffuse reflection, but if there was such a surface, we would see it with the same brightness in all viewing angles and also in all illumination angles of the light source.

All white things produce a great deal of diffuse reflection. We know this becasue they appear white regardless of the angle from which we view them.

> _Note_ | In addition to the **illumination angle**, the **contrast** of the light source also does not affect the appearance of a diffuse reflection.

> _Note_ | The **distance** from light to the surface does affect the diffuse reflection. The closer the light gets to the subject, the brighter the subject becomes. Decrease the distance by half, brightness increases 4 times (inverse squaer law).

### **Direct reflection**

Direct reflections are a mirror image of the light source that produces them. The point at which direct reflections can be seen is exactly determined by the angles between the light source, the subject, and the camera viewpoint.

If we stand directly in line with the reflection, we see the direct reflection comming from the surface as bright as the light source, regardless of the inverse square law.

The range of angles that would produce direct reflection is called the **family of angles**.

#### **The family of angles**

Any light positioned within the family of angles will produce a direct reflection. A light placed anywhere else will not.

If there is a surface that produce a huge amount of direct reflection, like a mirror or a polished metal, photographers would want to see direct reflection from most of the surface. This requires that they use a light large enough to fill the family of angles.

In other situations where they don't want any direct reflection, they must place both camera and the light so that the light source is not located within the family of angles.

#### **Polarized reflection**

A lake, painted metal, glossy wood, or plastic can all produce polarized reflection. Like other types of reflection, the polarization is not perfect. Some diffuse reflection and some unpolarized direct reflection are mixed with the glare.

Glossy subjects produce a greater amount of polarized reflection, but even matte surfaces prouce a certain amount.

Polarized direct reflection is more visible if the subject is black or transparent. Black and transparent subjects produce weaker diffuse reflection, making it easier to see the direct reflection.

##### **_Polarized reflection or ordinary direct reflection?_**

Here are some tips to distinguish between the two:

- If the surface is made of a material that conducts electricity (metal), its reflection is likely to be unpolarized. Electrical insulators (plastic, glass, and ceramics) are more likely to produce polarized reflection.
- If the surface looks like a mirror (bright metal), the reflection is likely to be simple direct reflection, not glare.
- If the surface does not have mirror-like appearance (polished wood, leather), the reflection is more likely to be polarized if the camera is seeing it at an angle of 40 to 50 degrees. At other angles, the reflection is more likely to be unpolarized direct reflection.
- The conclusive test, is the appearance of the subject through a polarizing filter. If the polarizer eliminates the reflection, then that reflection is polarized. If the polarizer has no effect on the suspect reflection, then it is ordinary direct reflection. If the polarizer reduces the brightness of the reflection but does not eliminate it, then it is a mixed reflection.

> _Note_ | placing a polarizing filter on the light source will turn a direct reflection into a polarized reflection. A polarizer on the camera lense can then manage the reflection.

# **Surface appearances**

All surfaces produce diffuse, direct, and polarized reflection in varying degrees.

Photographic lighting deals mainly with the exremes: the highlights and the shadows. Highlights and shadows together reveal form, shape, and depth. But highlight alone is usually enough to reveal what the surface of an object is like.

All surfaces produce both diffuse and direct reflections and some of the direct reflections are polarized. But most surfaces do not produce an even mix of these three types of reflection. The difference in the amounts of each of these reflections determines what makes on surface look different from another.

## **Photographer as editor**

One of the first steps in lighting a scene is to look at the subject and decide what kind of reflection causes the subject to appear the way it does.

The next step is to position the light, the subject, and the camera to make the photograph capitalize on that type of reflection and minimize others.

So we actually decide what kind of reflection we want the viewers to see.

## **Working with diffuse reflection**

Copy works (photographing paintings, illustrations, or antique photographs) is one simple example of when we usually want only diffuse, and not direct, reflection.

Diffuse reflection gives us information about how black or how white the subject is. Whites produce a great deal of diffuse reflection, and blacks produce little diffuse reflection.

Since diffuse reflection can also reflect light frequencies selectively, it also carries most of the color information about the subject.

Diffuse reflection does not tell us very much about what the surface material is. This is the job of direct reflection.

### **Angle of light**

Family of angles determine where the light sources should or should not be placed when doing a copy work.

Due to limits of the working space (museum, etc.), imposing restrictions on the position of the camera and light sources, we might need to widen or tighten the range of family angles. This is achivable by changing the distance between the camera and the subject, along with the resulting choice of the focal length of the camera lens.

### **Distance of light**

Diffuse reflections get brighter as the light gets closer to the reflecting surface.

Moving the light away from the subject makes the subject receive even illumination across its surface.

> _Note_ | In case we want to reveal the texture of a bright surface, we need to use shadows in addition to the diffue reflection. This would probably involve placing the light in a very shallow angle to the surface, so that it will give each particle of the texture a hightlight side and a shadow side. This may also involve moving the the light farther away from the subject in order to achieve even lighting. But if we were to reveal the texture of a dark surface, we will not be able to use the diffuse reflection anymore, since dark surfaces produce very little diffuse reflection. We may be able to increase exposure in order to record the little diffuse reflections on such surfaces, but that is usually not an option since bright areas almost always exist in our scene. So we may need to opt for direct reflection.

## **Working with direct reflection**

First, we must see where the family of angles might be. Then as for the light source, it must be large enough to completely fill the family of angles.

# **Portrait lighting**

Let's first go over different types of lighting in portrait photography.

## **Different types of lights**

### **Key light**

This is the most important light in the picture and it is also the most visibly present light in the image. The key light is generally the brightest and tends to be quite soft in most portrait situations.

### **Hair light**

Hair light brings out edge detail in the hair and highlight its shape. This is usually used when you want to separate your subject from the background. You may want this light very bright and visible or barely noticeable at all. The latter looks a lot more natural.

### **Fill light**

Fill light is used to decrease contrast on the subject in order to bring out shadow details. Fill is often a large light source placed behind the camera and you want the fill light to be as flat as possible as it is meant to slightly brighten the whole image. This light should not cast any shadows at all.

### **Side light**

It reveals only one side of the subject's face. It is used for [split](#split-light) setups. A very popular tool for side-lighting is a strip softbox. It is extremely important to use fill light with the side light.

### **Kick light**

Many people confuse a kick light with a hair light. Kick light is another way of highlighting the face, but the difference is that while a hair light will light up only hair, a kicker can do that, as well as light up a side of the subject's face. Kicker light is a key light.

### **Rim light**

This light is used to highlight the shape of the subject as well as provide additional separation from the background. They are commonly strip boxes because of the thin and tall light pattern that they form. Rim lights are very common when photographing athletes and fitness professionals as they will accentuate the subject's hard lines and body shape.

### **Catch light**

A catchlight is the little white spot often seen popping up inside the photo subject's eye. This is a very important light in portrait photography.

## **Basic light settings**

Here is a brief introduction to very basic portrait light settings that can be considered as fundamentals for other lightings.

### **Rambrandt**

This setting involves one main light diffuzed with softbox lighting the face of the subject at nearly `45` degree on the horizontal plane while its positioned about `50cm` above the subject's head. This will create the Rambrandt triangle on the subject's face.

As an addition to this setting, a reflector can be used on the opposite side of the main light to fill in the deep shadows created on the other side of the subject's face. Placing the reflector at closer distances from the subject will give us a more flat Rambrandt. We can even move the reflector a litte to the back of the subject in order create some **hair light**.

### **Split light**

This lighting splits the face right down the center. To implement this setting we have the main light from the Rambrandt setting, but we move it exactly to the side of the subject, making it light the subject at `90` degree.

Again a reflector can be used to flatten the hard shadows.

> Remember that this setting is used when the subject's body is turned to the light, but the head is turned back to the camera. If the subject turns their body away from the light, this will give us the **Broad light**. It is called Broad because now the camera is looking at the side of the face which is lit, while in Split light the camera looks at the side of the face which is in shadow.

### **Butterfly or Paramount light**

In this setting, the main light is positioned right next to the camera, at the same hight where it was used for Rambrandt or Split light. The light's horizontal distance from the subject would be about 2 meters. This setting gives us a little shadow under the nose, clear shadows on each side of the cheek, and also a shadow under the chin on the neck.

With a Butterfly light, a reflector is usually placed under the face to fill up the shadow created by the nose and the shadow on the neck. We could also use another softbox under the face.

### **Loop light**

It is called a loop because it does not close the loop on to the chin to become a Rambrandt. Basically, we get more light on the dark side of the face in comparison to the Rambrandt. In Rambrandt we only had a small triangle of light on the dark side, while here we clearly have more light and the eye on the dark side receives a noticable amount of light.

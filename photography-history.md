# **Introduction**

The concept of light writing, which is the basic meaning of the word 'photography', is a starting point for understanding photography. At the same time, it is important to appreciate that photography has never been one thing. In 1839, there were 3 types of photography: Daguerreotype which was a one-of-a-kind image, and two ways of producing photographs on paper invented by Talbot, one of which was called photogenic drawing. These two ways had the potential to be made into _negatives_, from which additional copies could be produced. Throughout its history, photography rapidly changed its technological means, though each type was a variant of light writing. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiii*]

Even before photography was presented to the world, the medium was grasped through the imagination and prior experience of those who read and heard about it. Soon, many different uses for photography appeared. Within a decade of its presentation to the world, photography was enmeshed in modernity while it helped to shape the modern condition in which knowledge is increasingly visualized. By 1852, photography was being used in such an extended domain that one concluded 'photography is at the same time a science, an art, and an industry.' [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiii*]

Photography has always been cross-diciplinary. Photographers who used the medium for artistic expression, record-keeping, journalism, scientific documentation, family history, or other diverse photographic endeavors reached beyond their immediate fields for inspiration and information. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiii*]

By 1850, photography was immersed in social debates and deeply at odds with itself. It was conjectured to be variously an art, a danger to art, a science, a revolutionary means of education, a mindless machine for rendering, and a threat to social order. Since photography appeared to be a relatively cheap way to disseminate information, it seemed to augur either a moder, bloodless, egalitarian revolution, or a social degeneration in which viewers would glut themselves with pleasing but trivial images of reality. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiii*]

The reproducibility of photography renders the medium unusually available. Early in its history, photographic images were regularly displayed in shop windows and shown by photographic societies. In the late 19th century, when technology allowed photographs to be printed directly in books and magainzes, the age of mass media began to take shape.

The basic relationship of the photograph and the viewer rests on a few elements: **informed observation**, **research**, and **contemplation**. Estelle Jussim wisely counseled that students of photography's past and present must 'expect complexity'. The richness and reward of photographic study comes from exploring the comprehensiveness of the medium. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiv*]

## **The problem of understanding the photographs**

Understanding photographs is different from looking at them. Understanding a photograph requires time and willingness to set aside the rapid-fire judgments applied to imagtes in the stream of daily life. Thought, research, and an occasional revision of initial imporessions are necessary, and these take more time than a brief look. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiv*]

The subject of a photogaraph has many facets. Subject includes, but reaches beyond, who or what is pictured in a photograph. Of course, associations are not permanent, but circumscribed by time, place, and audiences. Moreover, the subject of a photograph is inflected by elements of composition. Though it is often unfeasible to know how the image was treated in the darkroom or with photo-editing software, it is still necessary to remember that the photographer may make the picture after taking the picture. All of these components must be appreciated as choices made by the photographer, sometimes in an instant. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiv*]

Realism, the depiction of the external world as it appears to the eye, has long been a powerful pulse in Western art, ranging from Roman portraits to Dutch paintings of household scenes. But the destinctive realism of photography does not often fit into various historic moments of fine-art realism. The camera seemed to have the unique ability to soak up large quantities of visual detail. Therefore, its images were judged to be far less subjective than those made by other methods. Since photography was thought not to have an inherent style of its own, it quickly became synonymous with the making and collecting of objective images. Although the pursuit of photographic evidence in science and law is nearly as old as the medium, the underlying concepts of evidence and documentary expression have been frequently challenged. These contests of meaning, and all such disputes, are as much part of photography's history as are its technical acoomplishements. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiv-xv*]

Yet however widespread a photographic approach may seem, it is likely that images also possess a particular local resonance that cannot be generalized.

# **Introduction**

The concept of light writing, which is the basic meaning of the word 'photography', is a starting point for understanding photography. At the same time, it is important to appreciate that photography has never been one thing. In 1839, there were 3 types of photography: Daguerreotype which was a one-of-a-kind image, and two ways of producing photographs on paper invented by Talbot, one of which was called photogenic drawing. These two ways had the potential to be made into _negatives_, from which additional copies could be produced. Throughout its history, photography rapidly changed its technological means, though each type was a variant of light writing. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiii*]

Even before photography was presented to the world, the medium was grasped through the imagination and prior experience of those who read and heard about it. Soon, many different uses for photography appeared. Within a decade of its presentation to the world, photography was enmeshed in modernity while it helped to shape the modern condition in which knowledge is increasingly visualized. By 1852, photography was being used in such an extended domain that one concluded 'photography is at the same time a science, an art, and an industry.' [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiii*]

Photography has always been cross-diciplinary. Photographers who used the medium for artistic expression, record-keeping, journalism, scientific documentation, family history, or other diverse photographic endeavors reached beyond their immediate fields for inspiration and information. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiii*]

By 1850, photography was immersed in social debates and deeply at odds with itself. It was conjectured to be variously an art, a danger to art, a science, a revolutionary means of education, a mindless machine for rendering, and a threat to social order. Since photography appeared to be a relatively cheap way to disseminate information, it seemed to augur either a moder, bloodless, egalitarian revolution, or a social degeneration in which viewers would glut themselves with pleasing but trivial images of reality. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiii*]

The reproducibility of photography renders the medium unusually available. Early in its history, photographic images were regularly displayed in shop windows and shown by photographic societies. In the late 19th century, when technology allowed photographs to be printed directly in books and magainzes, the age of mass media began to take shape. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiv*]

The basic relationship of the photograph and the viewer rests on a few elements: **informed observation**, **research**, and **contemplation**. Estelle Jussim wisely counseled that students of photography's past and present must 'expect complexity'. The richness and reward of photographic study comes from exploring the comprehensiveness of the medium. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiv*]

## **The problem of understanding the photographs**

Understanding photographs is different from looking at them. Understanding a photograph requires time and willingness to set aside the rapid-fire judgments applied to imagtes in the stream of daily life. Thought, research, and an occasional revision of initial imporessions are necessary, and these take more time than a brief look. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiv*]

### **Subject in a photograph**

Even when the subject of a photograph is apparent, it is useful to recall that photorgaphs have many and sometimes overlapping storylines. The subject of a photogaraph has many facets. Subject includes, but reaches beyond, who or what is pictured in a photograph. Of course, associations are not permanent, but circumscribed by time, place, and audiences. Moreover, the subject of a photograph is inflected by elements of composition. Though it is often unfeasible to know how the image was treated in the darkroom or with photo-editing software, it is still necessary to remember that the photographer may make the picture after taking the picture. All of these components must be appreciated as choices made by the photographer, sometimes in an instant. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiv*]

### **Realism is photography**

Realism, the depiction of the external world as it appears to the eye, has long been a powerful pulse in Western art, ranging from Roman portraits to Dutch paintings of household scenes. But the destinctive realism of photography does not often fit into various historic moments of fine-art realism. The camera seemed to have the unique ability to soak up large quantities of visual detail. Therefore, its images were judged to be far less subjective than those made by other methods. Since photography was thought not to have an inherent style of its own, it quickly became synonymous with the making and collecting of objective images. Although the pursuit of photographic evidence in science and law is nearly as old as the medium, the underlying concepts of evidence and documentary expression have been frequently challenged. These contests of meaning, and all such disputes, are as much part of photography's history as are its technical acoomplishements. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xiv-xv*]

### **A medium based on multiples**

The reception of photographic images is shaped by the fact that photography has been, for the most part, a medium based on multiples. The sense that there is one original that exsists in only one place usually does not apply to photography. Prinst made by the photographers are sometimes valued more than prints made by an assistant or after the photographer's death, but to understand photography is to understand that the photogarpher was probably thinking about multiple images when the picture was taken. Sequencing photographs, whether for an exhibition, a book, a newspaper article, or a website, is an ongoing aspect of photography. Thinking in series may be done for a short period, or over a lifetime. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xv*]

#### **Marketing**

Marketing also plays a role in multiple images created by photography. Caleton Watkins used a special camera to make negatives from which he created Mammoth prints of the American West, usually bought by prosperous collectors as showpieces. Yet he also made smaller, more affordable photographs for tourist albums. **The same image was understood differently in separate contexts.** [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xv*]

### **Historical backgrounds**

A photograph may show what an important event looked like to an observer standing near the camera, but it cannot indicate the historical background. To understand why a photograph of an event looks the way it does, it is necessary to look beyond the frame and to ask how the picture relates to what happened. For instance, in war photography from late in WW2 to the present day, portraits of individual soldiers have been more popular with the public than images of generals and battles. To appreciate that situation, one has to look at **public perception** of modern warfare, and at how prior pictures in all media, especially in **mass media**, have shaped pictures of soldiers. Yet however widespread a photographic approach may seem, it is likely that images also possess a particular local resonance that cannot be generalized. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xv*]

### **Photographic genres**

Photographic genres have been very porous. Art photography has influenced newspaper imagery and vice versa. Aspects of experimental art photography - for example, the odd and abrupt angles of Russian photography after the Revolution or collages created between WW1 and WW2 - were adapted for advertising and documentary work. Scientific photographs of phenomena not seen by the human eye have been displayed for their aesthetic qualities, not their factual content. In current and historic photographic practice, photographers have blended visual and literary sources to create photofictions. In the recent years, ordinary snapshots have influenced art and photojournalism. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xv*]

### **Photographers' intentions**

Photographers' intentions are an amalgam of visual and topical possibilities. Aesthetic experimentaion and self-expression are not limited to art photography, but encompass all genres, including amateur and casual photography. A photographer's influences are not restricted to the visual arts. Although painting has regularly inflected photographic practice, literature, film, and mass media have also played significant roles in the field. Pinning down an image-maker's influences is as hard as analyzing how any individual comes to do and make certain things. Autobiographies, biographies, and artists' statements are valuable, but a life, like an image, always seems to evade exhaustive description. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xv*]

**John Berger once said: "The relationship between what we see and what we know is never settled." The meaning of photographs shift over time and in the appreciation of different audiences. Understanding photographs can never be complete.** [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, xv*]

# **Photography's double invention**

## **First invention**

The first invention of photography was during a period of largely concealed and scattered technological development, from the turn of the 18th century to 1839. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 1*]

The invention of photography did not depend directly on the impetus of a particular visual tradition, or even on a demonstrable social need. Instead, the climate of congenial attitudes toward toward material progress, research, and innovation encouraged its conception. Around 1800, Western European countries began to define **government's role** as fostering economic development through the expansion of industry and commerce. **Social progress** was understood to flow from the intellectual freedom of **individuals** seeking to solve scientific problems that would lead to practical applications. Those with the most to gain from this attitude toward change were the _educated classes_, as well as entrepreneurs, manufacturers, and enlightened landlords - people making up a **growing middle class** whose status was based on their **achievements and earnings**. The petite bourgeoisie, or lower middle class, also benefited from the outlook that **linked achievement to ability**. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 1*]

The primary elements of the photographic process began to come together and were experimented with in an era when practical, commercially feasible applications of scientific experiments were encouraged by **national policy** and **cultural values**. Independant entrepreneurs and business people started to believe that their investments in research might be awarded. Much of the history of early experiments in photography shows cultural attitudes prompting **resourceful individuals** to resolve practical problems and technical puzzles. In 1839, when the medium was disclosed, the industrializing world eagerly began to explore how it might be applied to **portraiture**, **record-keeping**, **political persuasion**, **academic investigation**, and **travel accounts**. Ten years later, the photographic subjects and applications began a swift proliferation that constituted a second invention, based partially on the **inclinations of individual photographers**, but also on the **needs of society**. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 1*]

## **Second invention**

The second invention of photography was in the decades after its disclosure, when it would be ceaselessly reinvented by the social uses to which it was put and the cultural dialogue surrounding it. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 1*]

The second invention of photography was based partially on the inclinations of individual photographers, but also on the needs of society. The market for portraits expanded, historical events began to be photographed, science and social science took up the medium, artists and artistically inclined photographers used the camera for personal expression and aesthetic exploration. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 1*]

# **The expanding domain**

In an 1857 article, **Lady Elizabeth Eastlake**, who marveled on the growth of photography since its disclosure to the world in 1839, wrote "Since then, photography has become a household word and household want; it is used alike by art, sience, by love, business, and justice; it is found in the most sumptuous salon, and in the dingiest attic." Photographic images were displayed in shop windows, and newspapers used photographic sources for their illustrations. At the same time, with the continued spread of photography, the development of new applications, and the **intense commercialization** of the medium in the late 1850s, amazement at its ability to capture appearances declined. As photography became more **commonplace**, the medium's **societal and artistic impact** was more frequently debated. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 76*]

The rapid commercialization of photography sprang from the interaction of **social needs** and **techincal inventions**. The convenience of the _Collodion_, or wet-plate, and the resulting **availablitiy of low-priced prints** stimulated the market for portraits of family, friends, and public figures. As different technologies speeded up communications, commerce, and travel, the **desire** for portraits and views kept pace. For instance, in the months leading up to the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the market for inexpensive portraits of people in the news grew at an unparalleled rate. Also, war and topical photography began to increase the public's demand for recent **images of important events**. Photographs from the Crimean War, from the Indian Mutiny, and the Americal Civil War were shown in galleries. Views of biblical and exotic places were alse demanded. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 76*]

At the same time, the growing market for low-priced photographs intensified the contrast between the so-called "cheap johns" who mass produced these, and those who hoped to elevate photography to the status of **fine art**. By the mid-1850s, members of the photographic society in England worried that members who made their living as photographers would degrade the society, and some attepted to pass a rule that would exclude from the society's exhibitions any photograph that had hung in a shop window. Ultimately, **High Art Photogarphy** was brough into being by photographers and critics concerned to link the new medium to the **betterment of individuals**. It put photography in the service of **public morality** by trying to make the medium ennoble and instruct its viewers in proper conduct. The perceived divide between **popular and art photogarphy**, begun in the middle of the 19th century, lasted almost one hundred years. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 76*]

# **Photography and modernity**

As a machine, the camera was aligned with the **first industrial revolution**. Electricity powered the second industrial revolution, which also included: the telephone; the radio; the combine; automatic looms in the textile industry; the adding machine; the widespread use of typewriters; and the electric light bulb, together with power plants and the network delivering electrical power. Many late 19th-century writers saw electricity as a metaphore for **rapid and powerful change**; the camera gave way to the dynamo. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 163*]

Photography was linked to the expansion of industrialization in other ways. Increasingly, the production of multiple photographs resembled that of the late 19th-century factory, which was coupled to national and international markets. **Postcards** and **stereographs** were mass produced for new audiences. Photogarphy was subjected to the **division of labor**, not just in the small factories that made stereographs and postcards, but in the experience of the amateur snapshooter. When the Kodak camera hit the market in 1888, it separated the act of taking photogarphs from the process of making photographs. Instead of processing photographs in the home darkroom, users sent the camera and film to Kodak, which developed and printed the image. Perhaps the greatest correlation between photography and the second industrialization was found in the production of illustrated newspapers and magazines. **Half-tone printing** allowed images and text to be printed together on high-speed presses, which, in turn, fostered the production of inexpensive daily illustrated newspapers, some of whose income came for photographically illustrated advertisements. These highly competitive pulications also promoted themselves by publishing topical and celebrity photographs. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 163*]

The perceived **vulgarity of mass culture** and the excitement of **modern art** combined to encourage photographers interested in art and personal expression to create a separate aesthetic, supported by publications, galleries, and exclusive societies. **Optical realism**, which was photography's major asset in mass media, was targeted in the European art movements that influenced art photogarphy, as well as in some of the scientific applications of the medium. The photogarphy of movement and the X-ray undermined the certainty of human perception. At the end of the era, the extensive death and brutality of WW1 brought into question both the social responsibility of science and the aspirations of art. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 163*]

# **A new vision**

In the 1920s, the industrialization of photography reached a new level, with the expansion of newspapers, general and special-interest magazines, and professional periodicals, all of which employed **photomechanical means of reproducing images**. In addition, the automatic photo machine, better known as the photo booth, was patented in 1928 and first set up in New York City's theater district, where it became immensly popular. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 233*]

By 1920, there were about 10 million registered automobiles in the US, and automobile production was about to become one of the nation's leading industries. By 1920, there were 7.5 million telephones in the US, while there were only 1 million in 1900. Widespread electrifictaion made possible radio stations and home radio receivers. Especially in European art movements, **photographic realism** was associated with the forces that culminated in WW2. The psychological devastation in the wake of the war seemed to clear a path of **experimental and non-linear art**. Clear subject matter and tidy compositions were critiqued and challenged by **abstract images** in which flat planes, strange shapes, and irrational shadows perplexed simple understanding. Experimental art broke out of the sedate gallery and into small, but widely circulated **avant-garde publication**. Advertising for upscale consumer items employed what was called the **new vision**, to glamorize products. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 233*]

The sustained world economic and industrial growth of the 1920s ended abruptly in 1929. In the US, the stock market crash on October 24, 1929, wiped out over 60% fo the value of securities, and set off a chain reaction of bank failures, factory shut-downs, and mortgage foreclosures. Franklin D. Roosevelt came to the American presidency with a broad series of recovery plans collectively known as the New Deal. Roosevelt, as was keenly aware of maintaining public faith in his good health, banned photographs showing him in his wheelchair. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 233*]

In the US, the **Depression** challenged the notion of America as a land of limitless opportunitiy for those willing to roll up their sleeves and work. As hard times were gradually perceived as an enduring, not temporary experience, many photographers relaxed the stiff graphics of Modernist photography and adapted them to interpretations of how people now lived. The clear close-ups of troubled faces, angled pictures of ragged breadlines, and angry contrasts between poverty and wealth were frequently called **documentary photographs**. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 233*]

The outbreak of WW2 in Europe and the entry of the US into the conflict were well recorded by the camera. The work of war photographers was carefully censored. In response, image-makers took to recording the daily life and war experience of soldiers and civilians. [*Cultural History of Photography - Mary Warner Marien, 233*]
